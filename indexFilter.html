        //In this example, we start with an array of numbers. We then use the filter method to create a new array called evenNumbers that only includes elements that are even. The filter method takes a callback function as its argument that is executed for each element in the original array. If the callback function returns true, the element is included in the new array. If the callback function returns false, the element is excluded.

        //In this case, the callback function checks if the current number is even by using the modulo operator % to determine if the number is divisible by 2 with no remainder. If the number is even, the function returns true and the number is included in the new array. If the number is odd, the function returns false and the number is excluded. Finally, we log the evenNumbers array to the console.






        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

        const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(function(number) {
        return number % 2 === 0;
        });

        console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
